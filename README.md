Contact List
============

http://support.proboards.com/thread/638474/simple-embeddable-contact-list

Request done for http://innovation.thecreed.online

Code is specifically aimed at the custom structure for the forum above, but can easily be tweaked to work on other forums.

Adds an Add / Remove Contact button to profiles that allow people to add the user to a their private contact list.

As there is no easy way to query if a contact is online, it relies on looking at various things on the forum (info center, profile).
